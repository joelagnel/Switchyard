//! Ensemble router built on the [`Algorithm`] interfaces.
//!
//! Each request is fanned out to a set of candidate models concurrently; a judge
//! model (e.g. Haiku) then picks the best response, which is returned to the
//! agent. The algorithm tallies which candidate the judge preferred across
//! requests and, after `exploration_turns` ensemble turns, commits to the
//! winningest model — every subsequent request routes straight to that one model
//! with no fan-out and no judge call.
//! Run with:
//!   NVIDIA_API_KEY=... cargo run -p switchyard-libsy --example ensemble
//!
//! Unlike the reference routers, this algorithm is **stateful**: the win tally,
//! the reserved/completed exploration counters, and the committed choice live
//! behind a [`parking_lot::Mutex`] so one shared `&self` can serve a session's
//! requests concurrently (see the `Algorithm` docs); a [`tokio::sync::Notify`]
//! wakes a request waiting for the exploration budget to finish. In a proxy setup
//! one `EnsembleOrchAlgo` is created per session, so this state is per-session.
